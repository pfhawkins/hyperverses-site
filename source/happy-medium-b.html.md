His mother sits at the kitchen table  
With a pack of smokes and a bodice-ripper,  
Comforted by the assemblage of tropes  
Into linear plots of [transgression](/happy-medium-a.html).  
To be put back on the shelf when the  
Package is fully unwrapped, soon  
To be passed (like a stool) to the thrift store.
