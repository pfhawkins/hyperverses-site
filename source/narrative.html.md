[Narrative](http://hypervers.es/hv-linearity.html) is what drives all reading and
writing. Naturally, it is a glaring concern of this site. 

This site's [colophon](http://hypervers.es/colophon.html) is as much
a narrative of how the site came to be as [the official narrative of how the
site came to be](http://hypervers.es/on-hyperverses.html).

Robert Hugh Benson hinted in one of his novels that narrative [could be
abused](http://hypervers.es/newspaper-pessimism.html).

And because I have no better place to mention it, let it be known that I had an opinion about [Nick Carr's
opinion](http://hypervers.es/carr-tweetform-thesis-3.html) on narrative.
