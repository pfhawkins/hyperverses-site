As is usual in these cases, a soothsayer was consulted. 

“Whaddya want?”

“I find sitting and reading something through to the end to be a far
heavier burden than in my youth. What must I do to regain this faculty?”

“I am a soothsayer, not a healer.”

“But surely being a soothsayer, wise in the world's ways and long in years,
you have seen the cause of this before.”

“It is ever the same. The problem is you.”

“Look, I paid you five *drachma*, and in return you tell me something I already know?”

“Fair enough,” said the soothsayer. He closed his eyes, threw a pinch of
incense into the flaming bowl, and began to intone:

*Lo, there was a time upon the earth when a group of the literate decided to harness
text to computation. And they wove strange narratives, and sent them out to the
world on small wires. And it seemed as if the stories had shattered along the
journey. But these ergodics had accounted for this from the beginning, and had
foretold of this from tomes of yore.*

*And they sang of [hypertext](/hypertext.html); and they sang
of [narrative](/narrative.html); and they sang of
[complexity](/ergodic.html).*

*This is an account of the [hyperverses](/on-hyperverses.html) they left in their wake.*
