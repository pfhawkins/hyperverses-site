description: A Weekly Email containing some Links.
---

When I started Hyperverses, I imagined it solely as
a traditional website. I have not written for it as much as I originally
intended. But in that whole time, I've
kept reading and reading on hypermedia, web technology, and digital
humanities. My primary venue for learning and sharing has been the
[@hyperverses](http://twitter.com/hyperverses) twitter account.

It's easy to miss things on twitter. While there's a lot of good stuff on @hyperverses, I know that
sometimes I simply tweet too darn much. I figured there should be another way
to share the best stuff, to get the cream without the skim.

To that end I'm starting [***Hyperverses Weekly***](http://eepurl.com/kAxU9), an email newsletter.

## What's In It For Me If I Subscribe?

Once a week, I will email you 4-5 links on the following topics:

* hypertext
* hypermedia
* web technology
* digital humanities
* design/UX

In short, pretty much anything that is interesting and relevant to humans interacting with computers
and each other.

I will also be able to go into a bit more length on *why* I find that
particular link compelling. (Not a lot though! Just a paragraph or so.)

## What Will You Do With My Email Address?

Email you once a week with 4-5 links. That's it.

One of the links may turn out to be something I've made or written. But I will
not sell your address to third parties. I will not start emailing you more
frequently than once a week. 

The mailing itself will be handled by [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com), a reputable
provider of mailing lists. They will punish me if I misbehave.

## Sounds Good, Where Do I Sign Up?
