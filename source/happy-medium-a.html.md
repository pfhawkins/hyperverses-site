The theoretician sits at the page  
Stares at the screen's bright-backed glow  
And wills the reception of words  
As ordered as 'lectrons on a platter.  
For the horizon of youth is tired, dusty.  
A new horizon must be sought  
In the scrambled assemblages'  
Deforestation of [ancestral
structures](/happy-medium-b.html);  
Vomiting meanings, knifing narratives.
