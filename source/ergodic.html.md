For a topic as [intricate](http://hypervers.es/carr-tweetform-thesis-1.html) as
complexity, there isn't much on the topic.

One shining example of ergodicity with a purpose is Mark Danielewski's *[House
of Leaves](http://hypervers.es/house-of-leaves.html)*.

Oh, this bit on [linearity](http://hypervers.es/hv-linearity.html) is relevant.
