Hypertext as commonly practiced leads to navigational detritus floating at the
edges of the page. ([This site](/on-hyperverses.html) is no
exception.) Adhering to this practice has almost [become *de
rigeur*](/carr-tweetform-thesis-2.html). Avoiding it would
mean writing original navigational prose each time a 
[node](/what-nodes-may-be.html) is updated.

Some would say that the effort of maintaining such
[non-linear](/hv-linearity.html) navigation is not worth it.
But for now, while still relying on [traditional navigational
detritus](/son-of-footnote.html) (and
a honking [big list](/biglist.html)), this site intends to
write prose paths to each node. No matter how torturous the prose becomes.
