Hyperverses is a web site. Each page is compiled as [HTML](http://www.w3.org/html/) from [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) formatted plain text. The pages are served by an [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org) web server. 

The bit that does the marshalling from markdown bits to a full-fledge HTML site is [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com). Middleman was chosen because it is not blog software. [I](http://pfhawkins.com) aim to build a website, not a blog. A blog has particular trappings such as calendar pages, a long scroll of a post-filled index page, categories. Sometimes comments. Hyperverses is a series of linked pages. The index is simply the most recently composed page. In this way the most fresh utterance becomes the primary entry point into the site.

Using middleman to build the site gives me a playground to tinker in. Hyperverses explores textuality and digitality, and extending middleman to suit my own experimentations is very much a part of that.

One day, if I am a good boy and can coax the muses into imbuing me with good coding practices, I might release a middleman plugin-as-CMS.

## Typography {#typography}

Currently there are no images on Hyperverses. This may change. I enjoy the written word more than video and the visual arts. I am not insensible to graphic design, however. I spent longer than I ought to have picking out fonts and tweaking the spacing and column width, among other things. The site title is set in LMR. The titles are set in Market Deco, red. The body text is set in Theano Old Style. All are generously licensed and freely available online.

Links on Hyperverses hopefully flatter traditional paper highlighters with imitation. Unvisited links have a yellow background, and visited a blue. Hyperverses is also concerned with analog methods of producing and consuming the written word, so I felt this slight homage was warranted. It is my only nod to skeumorphism.

## Missing {#missing}

While the site is not a blog, it ought to have an [RSS feed](http://www.whatisrss.com). It does not. It will.

The site has footnotes. It does not yet have a navigational scheme of any real utility. [A list of every page](/biglist.html) is not going to cut it.

While each update to the site is captured in a [git repository](https://github.com/pfhawkins/hyperverses-site), I do not yet have navigable versioning set up for individual lexia. Then again, I haven't felt the need to revise any published lexia yet either.

## Text Editors {#editors}

I collect text editors like Sauron collects jewelry. My go-to text editor is [vim](http://www.vim.org). I cut my teeth on, and still get use out of, [emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). Portions of this site have also been written in [Mou](http://mouapp.com), [Byword](http://bywordapp.com), and [Writing Kit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/writing-kit-research-write/id426208994?mt=8). I primarily use Writing Kit on the iPad, and am very inconsistent with what I use on a computer. Writing Kit's killer feature is the ability to set a dark background, facilitating nighttime writing. I used to write in [Moleskine Cahier notebooks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8883704940/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=8883704940&linkCode=as2&tag=phawkcom-20), but then I took an iPad to the knee. 

## What To Make Of This {#whatthe}

This site is a product of my sensibilities. In 2002 I ditched Windows in favor of Linux. I have primarily used Macs since 2011. I spend more time composing in vim and emacs than in web forms. I think plain text is a pretty neat idea. I dig footnotes[^dig-it]. I am pretty skeptical about hypertext, actually. I hate it when people redefine words. Reading means reading words, possibly with illustrations or inside of comics. (Unless you are visually impaired, in which case my personal taxonomy starts to totter.) I read way too much [ftrain](http://www.ftrain.com) in college. When [@eastgate](http://twitter.com/eastgate) notices something I've said on twitter, he tends to [disagree with me](http://twitter.com/eastgate/status/259712311189721088). He is far more knowledgeable about hypertext than I. I am still learning. I will get things wrong. Heck, I am getting things wrong right now. Most of what I've written on this page should not be in a colophon. That's just not what a colophon is for. You know, I'm not entirely sure what a colophon *is* for. I just added [a book on colophons](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1178571610/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1178571610&linkCode=as2&tag=phawkcom-20) to my Amazon wish list. Maybe someday I will write a better colophon.

[^dig-it]: My best friend made fun of me the other day for reading [a book on footnotes](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674307607/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0674307607&linkCode=as2&tag=phawkcom-20).
