A node is something that nobody can agree on what it is, apart from the notion that it is the fundamental unit of hypertext.

Hendrik Christando defines "node" in a [class assignment](http://www.cyberartsweb.org/cpace/ht/christanto/el_of_htext.htm) for [George Landow](http://www.victorianweb.org/cv/landow_ov.html) as "â€¦a collection of data organized around a specific topic."

A definition so broad means the term is essentially undefined. Why a collection of data? Is text data? Why does the collection have to be focused on a topic? Couldn't it cover a swath of topics?

[TermWiki defines a node](http://www.termwiki.com/EN:hypertext_node) as "a complete module of information that is linked to other relevant modules by hypertext links." "Complete module of information" seems a bit closer, but is still problematic as a definition. What makes a node complete? Must it contain information? Couldn't a node contain incomplete nonsense?

Then again, the second part of the definition rings more true. Nodes are linked to. Links link to nodes.

[Jakob Nielson](http://www.useit.com/papers/hypertext_theory/) defines node in the negative as I started to above: "Nodes are the fundamental unit of hypertext, but there is no agreement as to what really constitutes a 'node.'" He then goes on to distinguish between frame-based and windows-based nodes, which has little bearing on the matter at hand.

[Dorian Taylor](http://doriantaylor.com/person/dorian-taylor) does not set out to define nodes as such, but makes a [helpful distinction](http://doriantaylor.com/policy/uris-resources-and-representations) between [representations](http://doriantaylor.com/lexicon/representation) and [resources](http://doriantaylor.com/lexicon/resource).[^digression]

[^digression]: As helpful as this distinction is, it still feels squishy. Anything can be a resource, but we can only link to representations of it? What does this added layer of complexity gain us? 

## The Official Hyperverses Definition

**A Node is that which one receives after clicking a link.**

It necessarily follows that a node under the Hyperverses definition refers to a representation, not a resource.
